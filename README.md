# hello-world
An introduction to GitHub repository
I'm a musician and developer and I'm transitioning from full time musician to full time delevoper. I've been building, fixing, and managing Wordpress sites for over 10 years as a side hussle. I'm proficient in JavaScript, React, Java, Spring Boot, and PHP. I love the Web Audio API and am currently enrolled in LaunchCode's Full Stack Dev boot camp. 

I also build and sell max for live devives custom made and commercially offered.
